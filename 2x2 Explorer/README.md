An explorer for two player simultaneous move games with pre-set payoffs for common games (Chicken, Matching Pennies, Prisoner's Dilemma...) made in HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript

Future plans: plot graphs of best response correspondences and improve the design

The HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript files are not linked up as they are copies from my developing the explorer in Codepen.io where you can see the explorer in action: https://codepen.io/Latindude101/pen/abzMzVr
